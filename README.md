The purpose of this project was to create a solution utlizing AI on a SIEM tool to help analyze, categorize, and prioritze security alerts which is hosted on AWS. With AI implmented into this tool, it can help us eliminate the amount of false positives/negatives that can help reduce the incident response times during cyberattacks. This product will allow security analysts to interact with the AI model hosted on the SIEM tool to create a smooth experience when searching through logs and vulnerabilities.
